# About wxIA
wxIA is a collection of cross-platform image acquisition classes for the wxWidgets GUI class library providing access to native image acquistion API's. Current support is for TWAIN on Windows (and soon on Mac, hopefully) and SANE on Linux. It was created by Derry Bryson in 2003.

# Goal
The goal is to revive wxIA to make it work under Windows 7/8 and Linux.
